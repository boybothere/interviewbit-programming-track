# Which of the given options provides the increasing order of complexity of functions f1, f2, f3 and f4:

a. f1(n) = 2^n

b. f2(n) = n^(3/2)

c. f3(n) = nLogn

d. f4(n) = n^(Logn)

# Solution
Considering the options given option a and b are already exponential including option d so option c comes first

now if we consider n = 10000 then optioin b will be 1000^1.5 while option d will be 10000^4 (considering log base 10)

Then obviosuly its very evident for optioin a to be the one with the most growth rate

# Therefore final order given by: c < b < d < a
