# What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
## A. X will always be a better choice for all inputs
## B. X will always be a better choice for large inputs
## C. X will always be a better choice for small inputs
## D. Y will always be a better choice for small inputs

## Solution:
For this question answer will be option B. because in asymptotic efficiency we measure the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity hence when we say X is more asymptotically efficient then we mean that the algo's growth rate for larger inputs will be slower than that of Y, hence X outperforms Y.
